## What we learned

- Building a game in React Native can be challenging (and not always recommended 😅), but since our game is pretty simple and doesn't require a lot of physics, we thought it would be interesting to try and develop one. Nobody in our group has ever built a game, so it was a nice learning experience!
- Most of us weren't familiar with React Native and mobile development in general. It was a nice surprise to see how easy and fun it is to develop a React Native app, especially using Expo. We recommend Expo to anyone who is curious about mobile development, as it is very beginner friendly. 

## Challenges

- dealing with state management without Redux
- figuring out styling 🙄

## What's next?

- adding sound effects!
- implementing a global leaderboard rather than local (add database)
- adding a nicer landscape for the game's screen (mountains))
- adding multiple player / competition mode
- publishing / deploying ✨!
